## Employee-Directory

This is an employee directory React app. 
It gathers a list of employees(We're using "Random users API: `https://randomuser.me/api/?results=200&nat=us`" to demo it).
You can then use the search box and sort drop down to search by name or sort by first name or last name, a-> z or z->a.
